### This is a Lab project in my Math Senior Inquiry Class for Heat Equation Modelling

- [ ] To run, go to the main_test.py file and run the script on the terminal (ensure that the imports are on your machine).
- [ ] In main_test.py, if you want to change the initial conditions, boundary conditions, beta, delta_t, delta_x, length of rod, etc, refer to large comments instructing to do so.
- [ ] If you want to change running condition for sigma (if CFL is wrong, the program automatically exits), then go to line 50 and comment out exit()
- [ ] Press Y/N to choose whether or not you want to plot animation of the rod's heat changes.
